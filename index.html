The brand represents a home for basketball, a limitless haven to play the game, to experience the passion that stokes its flames and where the greatest stories can be told. A country’s unique love for basketball gave birth to a dream – in its essence, the Filipino love for the game itself is built on dreams.</p><p>TITAN is that dream come to life, meant to deepen the relationship of a nation to a beloved sport, meant to explore where that dream can take us, but also where we can take the dream.</p><p>From our origins, throughout the journey, always for love of the game.</p></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 text-center d-flex align-items-center"> <div class="py-10 center-block" data-aos="fade-up"> <p>This is a story - of a brand, of the country that birthed it, of the community that embraced it and the love they share for the game.</p><p>From Manila, to the World.</p></div></div></div></section> </article> <article class="bg-black py-5"> <section class="container-fluid"> <div class="row no-gutters"> <div class="col-lg-6 p-5"> <img data-src="images/lzr.jpg" data-aos="fade-up" class="sticky-img lazy" alt="Levon Rondina"> </div><div class="col-lg-6 p-5" style="height:100%;"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-12"> <h2 class="m-0">Levon Rondina</h2> <h4 class="mt-0">CO-FOUNDER, CHIEF BRAND OFFICER</h4> <h3>“Honestly, I don’t think there was.

It was a groundbreaking task: a single-category store dedicated solely to basketball, for Filipino basketball fans. In the beginning, the founders had only but each other to mount office furniture, to place orders, to envision and eventually create the store itself. Now Chief Brand Officer, Levon remembers his very first task as soon as TITAN opened: be its first Store Manager.</p><p class="indent">A little over a month after its doors opened, the spark of an idea actually ignited. Literally. A vintage barber’s chair overheated in the middle of the night, caught fire and almost burned the whole store, the whole dream, to the ground. “It was a sad sight but we went in as soon as the smoke cleared to clean the whole space covered in soot ourselves and opened a few days after like nothing happened.”</p><p class="indent">Ten years later, TITAN has come farther and further than the founders initially planned. But the dream lives on: to serve the basketball community the world over, and introduce to them what the famous Filipino Love for the Game has given birth to.</p></div><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-12 col-xl-6"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12 col-xs-6 col-12"> <figure><img data-aos="fade-up" data-src="images/lzr-02.jpg" alt="Levon Rondina" class="img lazy"/></figure> </div><div class="col-lg-12 col-xs-6 col-12"> <figure><img data-aos="fade-up" data-src="images/lzr-03.jpg" alt="Levon Rondina" class="img lazy"/></figure> </div></div></div></div></div></div></section> </article> <article class="bg-black py-5"> <section class="container-fluid"> <div class="row no-gutters"> <div class="col-lg-6 p-5"> <img data-src="images/coach.jpg" data-aos="fade-up" class="lazy sticky-img" alt="Jeffrey Cariaso"> </div><div class="col-lg-6 p-5" style="height:100%;"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-12"> <h2 class="m-0">Jeffrey Cariaso</h2> <h4 class="mt-0">CO-FOUNDER, PBA LEGEND</h4> <h3>“What will remain true about the brand is our goal to remain the innovators and authenticators of the game.”</h3> </div><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-12 col-xl-6"> <p class="drop"><span class="gold">WHILE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS</span> that stand out about Titan as a basketball retailer, the most definable aspect of the brand that was built FLOTG can be seen through the heart and hands of Jeffrey “The Jet” Cariaso. </p><p class="indent">As one of TITAN’s co-founders, Coach Jeff is the driving force behind the brand’s various grassroots programs and initiatives such as the Titan Basketball Academy, SLAM Summer Hoops Camp, Titan Summer Jam, and the Deer Valley Titans––all of which were conceived for the sole purpose of bringing Philippine basketball to greater heights by playing the game the right way. </p><p class="indent">Through his experiences as a player and Head Coach of the Alaska Aces, everything Coach Jeff teaches has a purpose, ready to be passed on to the next generation of ballers and leaders of the game. “The values I use to guide and lead at TITAN are the same values I use at Alaska. A hard work ethic and passion are the basics. What you hold each other more accountable to are discipline, honesty, integrity, and trust.

Allyn would be the first to tell you however, that the road map he followed from the start was always going to lead him here. </p><p class="indent">“LeBron’s ‘Strive for Greatness’ mantra applies to everything for me. Many of LeBron’s traits are shared by us Filipinos, but I think what resonates the most is his unfading desire to work really hard on his craft. We’re hard workers, we give 100% in everything we do, just like the man himself. I think that’s why many of us look up to him. The journey that he had to go through, from being a kid from Akron to becoming a global icon, his dedication and passion towards what he does on and off the court is truly inspiring.” </p><p class="indent">And that, in a single quote, is Allyn’s story, is TITAN’s story, is the Filipino story. </p><p class="indent">Strive for Greatness, The King said.

He went all in. He proudly waved the flag. More than his skills and physical gifts, it was his dedication and commitment to the game that defined his legendary basketball career. It was his sacrifices, his determination to win that truly represented Filipino basketball on the world stage––a true embodiment of the TITAN spirit. </p><p class="indent">Today, the 38-year-old forward has made it his personal mission to inspire the next generation, and ignite the fire inside them. “It’s not about the talent, it’s about hard work,” the National Team and PBA veteran says. “Alam naman natin na underdog tayo, pero naipakita naman natin na kaya natin makipagsabayan sa kanila kahit maliliit tayo kasi nandoon naman ‘yung determination mo na gusto mong manalo, kasi ibibigay mo talaga one hundred percent mo.” </p><p class="indent">(“We know that we’re underdogs.

A fan of the brand since high school, Thirdy went through it all––from waiting in line at special releases to being a sneaker raffle hopeful. He still recalls being fueled by the excitement of being invited to the first-ever SLAM Rising Stars Classic in 2014. And he’s come a long way since—clinching three straight UAAP titles with a Finals MVP trophy next to each, and even earning his spot on the National Team roster. </p><p class="indent">All of these achievements are products of his insane work ethic, fierce competitive drive, and unwavering love for the game. He may have already stepped out of his family’s shadow, but the 23-year old is nowhere near done carving his own path and feeding his hunger for challenges. His next chapter?
