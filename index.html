                            <p>TITAN - founded in 2010 - is a product and an expression of the Filipino’s fabled love for basketball. The country’s undeniable fascination for the game – both religious and fanatical – is legendary the world over.</p>
                            <p>TITAN was born of this love, is shaped by its culture and strives to take that relationship to greater heights. The brand represents a home for basketball, a limitless haven to play the game, to experience the passion that stokes its flames and where the greatest stories can be told. A country’s unique love for basketball gave birth to a dream – in its essence, the Filipino love for the game itself is built on dreams.</p>
                            <p>TITAN is that dream come to life, meant to deepen the relationship of a nation to a beloved sport, meant to explore where that dream can take us, but also where we can take the dream.</p>
                            <p>From our origins, throughout the journey, always for love of the game.</p>

                                <h3 class="m-0">“Honestly, I don’t think there was. Personally, I cannot remember that there was, even an ounce of doubt.”</h3>
                                <p>MORE THAN A GAME. While there were many challenges, many unknowns, many uncertainties that came with giving up everything to go double-down on a never-before-attempted start-up, it was the knowledge – that to Filipinos,</p>
                                <p>basketball is more than just another sport – that inspired the founders of TITAN to create a home for the truest fans of the game.</p>
                                <p>In 2010, Levon Rondina was sitting in an office barely big enough for him and the three other pioneer employees of TITAN. It was a groundbreaking task: a single-category store dedicated solely to basketball, for Filipino basketball fans. In the beginning, the founders had only but each other to mount office furniture, to place orders, to envision and eventually create the store itself. Now Chief Brand Officer, Levon remembers his very first task as soon as TITAN opened: be its first Store Manager.</p>
                                <p>A little over a month after its doors opened, the spark of an idea actually ignited. Literally. A vintage barber’s chair overheated in the middle of the night, caught fire and almost burned the whole store, the whole dream, to the ground. “It was a sad sight but we went in as soon as the smoke cleared to clean the whole space covered in soot ourselves and opened a few days after like nothing happened.”</p>
                                <p>Ten years later, TITAN has come farther and further than the founders initially planned. But the dream lives on: to serve the basketball community the world over, and introduce to them what the famous Filipino Love for the Game has given birth to.</p>
